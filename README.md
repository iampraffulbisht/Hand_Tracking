Hand Tracking with MediaPipe

This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe, a powerful machine learning framework for building multi-modal applications. By leveraging MediaPipe's Hands solution, you can detect and visualize hand landmarks in a video stream, making it suitable for various interactive experiences.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following software installed on your desktop:

Python 3.x: Download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
pip: pip is the package installer for Python. If you installed Python correctly, pip should be included. You can verify its installation by running python -m pip --version in your terminal.
Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

opencv-python: For video capture, image processing, and display. Install it using pip install opencv-python.
mediapipe: For hand landmark detection. Install it using pip install mediapipe.
Installation

Clone the Repository:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired project directory. Then, clone this repository using the following command:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-tracking-with-mediapipe.git
Use code with caution.

Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the cloned project directory using:

Bash
cd hand-tracking-with-mediapipe
Use code with caution.

Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

A requirements.txt file can be created to list dependencies, but it's optional for this simple project.

Running the Project

Execute the Script:
Run the main Python script using the following command:

Bash
python hand_tracking.py
Use code with caution.

This will launch a webcam window displaying your hand with detected landmarks visualized as circles and connections.

Terminate the Application:
Press the q key on your keyboard to quit the program.

Customization (Optional)

FPS Display: You can modify the script to display the frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring.
Landmark Colors: You can change the colors used to draw circles and connections on the hand landmarks.
Advanced Interactions: Explore integrating hand tracking with other functionalities, such as mouse control or gesture recognition.
Additional Notes

Ensure you have a webcam connected to your computer for the video stream.
Adjust the webcam resolution settings if you encounter performance issues.
